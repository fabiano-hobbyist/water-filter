# water-filter
My litle project of home automation for a water filter. Working on improving the code.

The idea is very simple here: a solenoid valve controls water flow, while a hall effect sensor monitors the water volume that passedthe filter.
An encoder is used to allow a custom volume of water to be set, and a LED display shows the information to the user.
Also a little menu allows for some parameters tweaking.

It was implemented using a raspberry pico as microcontroller and micropython as programming language.
